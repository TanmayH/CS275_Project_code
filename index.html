    <P><b>Abstract - </b>Artificial synthesis of human facial models continues to be an active area of research, sitting at
        the intersection of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Artificial Life. Spanning across
        various fields from medicine to film, the key task remains generating expressive and accurate three-
        dimensional renderings of human faces. Interestingly, facial synthesis has also seen active interest in
        the two-dimensional domain, with an increasing use of Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) to
        generate and manipulate human face renderings. This project thus attempts to take a step towards
        combining the research in these various disciplines, integrating the fields of Natural Language
        Processing, 2-D text guided manipulation, and 3-D model capture and rendering. Specifically, this
        project attempts to create a “text-to-3D-model” pipeline, generating three-dimensional faces to convey
        the emotion carried by a piece of text.</P>
